Acting as a “title” to everyday goods or virtual property, PRüF tokenized assets allow the protections of title to extend to all your valuables. PRüF Private-Provenance allows rights holders to securely hold, transfer, sell and collateralize their possessions without opening their lives to scrutiny. PRüF as a platform enables non-technical individuals and teams to issue media-rich, customized NFTs for projects involving art, collectibles, and other assets. In addition to everyday items, collectibles, heirlooms, and capital goods under personal ownership, PRüF tokenized assets open up a multitude of options for discreet and protected arms-length control.
